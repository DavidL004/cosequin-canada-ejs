            "question": "WHAT IS <span class=\"regulatory\">COSEQUIN</span>?",
            "answer": "<span class=\"regulatory\">COSEQUIN</span> is a scientifically researched nutritional supplement formulated to help dogs maintain healthy joints. <span class=\"regulatory\">COSEQUIN</span> joint health supplements are made with high-quality ingredients and subjected to stringent quality control measures to ensure they meet label claim. <span class=\"regulatory\">COSEQUIN</span> Maximum Strength Plus MSM contains Glucosamine Hydrochloride, Sodium Chondroitin Sulfate, and MSM (Methylsulfonylmethane). This combination of ingredients helps maintain your dogâ€™s cartilage and connective tissue. Each chewable tablet also contains Hyaluronic acid (HA), a main component of synovial fluid found in joints and a key component of healthy joints in dogs."
        },
        {
            "question": "WHAT IS JOINT CARTILAGE?",
            "answer": "Cartilage is a slippery and resilient tissue produced and maintained by its own specialized cells. It cushions the surfaces where two or more bones meet to form a flexible joint."
        },
        {
            "question": "HOW DOES <span class=\"regulatory\">COSEQUIN</span> JOINT HEALTH SUPPLEMENT WORK?",
            "answer": "The ingredients in <span class=\"regulatory\">COSEQUIN</span> work together to help support and protect the cartilage. Glucosamine hydrochloride acts as a building block of cartilage by supplying a key nutrient that keeps cartilage healthy and functioning properly. Chondroitin sulfate supports healthy joint function. MSM provides additional joint health support. Hyaluronic Acid (HA) provides viscosity to the synovial fluid, supporting joint function and reducing friction between joint surfaces."
        },
        {
            "question": "ARE THERE ANY SIDE EFFECTS?",
            "answer": "Some dogs may experience a mild gastrointestinal upset, similar to symptoms which occur when food is switched. If this is the case, you can try offering <span class=\"regulatory\">COSEQUIN</span> with a meal."
        },
        {
            "question": "I GIVE MY DOG A FOOD THAT CONTAINS GLUCOSAMINE AND CHONDROITIN SULFATE.<br>DO I STILL NEED <span class=\"regulatory\">COSEQUIN</span>?",
            "answer": "Yes. The amount of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate in dog food is often minimal. Even if these diets contained high-quality glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, your dog may need to consume more than the daily requirement of food to obtain the amounts of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate found in <span class=\"regulatory\">COSEQUIN</span>. In addition, both glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate may degrade when subjected to heat or extreme pressure during the manufacturing process of commercial dog food."
